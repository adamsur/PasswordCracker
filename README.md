# PasswordCracker
A small cracker that can take a wordlist and a NT, LM, or Unix hash and determine if there's a password match.

# Purpose
I made this cracker with the purpose of getting better at Python scripting while also adding a bit of security to it. Through this project 
I learned about implementing and parsing arguments that occur directly in the command line, as well as, continously checking for scenarios in
which an error may occur.
